# Welcome to framework3 ðŸ‘‹

We're working on a better way to build modern web applications.

## ðŸŒˆ Contribution and Usage Guidelines

Unlike most projects you might come across, framework3 is a proprietary project at heart. While we'll gratefully accept contributions in terms of time, effort, and even money, none of that will affect our core product roadmap.

We're building `f3` with monetization in mind upfront - for ourselves (to be able to sustain this project for a long time to come), and for you (so that you can get paying projects out the door faster). That means that the main product (the `f3` binary) operates under a proprietary license, with the following basic rules:

* If you can download `f3` and use it, consider it "free as in beer" - do whatever the heck you want with it. Whatever code the tool can produce, is yours to keep!
* If you have a copy of the `f3` binary and are considering decompiling it as part of understanding how it works, rather contact us first - we'd be happy to explain, ideally by writing technical documentation for you.
* If you can clone the `f3` repo (as a contributor), consider it proprietary and secret - and before you get to this point, you'll already be aware of what your rights are.

Other than using it, there are other ways to contribute that we would be grateful for:

* Find a bug? Please log it in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/framework3/.github/issues).
* Need a new feature? Please [start a new Ideas thread](https://github.com/orgs/framework3/discussions/new?category=ideas).
* Just have a question? We've got a [Q&A board just for that](https://github.com/orgs/framework3/discussions/new?category=q-a).
* Made something cool? We'd love to see it on [the Show & Tell board](https://github.com/orgs/framework3/discussions/new?category=show-and-tell)!

## ðŸš€ Roadmap

As of 2025, these are the main projects on the roadmap:

* f3 itself - getting the core framework, binary and processes worked out
* framework3.net - A website built using f3, demonstrating f3's capabilities
* docs.framework3.net - A sub-domain for all technical documentation
* framework3.cloud - a global, scalable hosting solution built into the framework, with free and paid options (our main monetization strategy)
* framework3.org - A go-to for community resources on learning, using, scaling and securing framework3 projects
